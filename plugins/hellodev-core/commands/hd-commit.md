description: Verify, then commit with a Conventional Commit message
argument-hint: [--push] [--pr] [message hint]
---

Commit the current work.

Use the `commit-workflow` skill, and the `repo-hygiene` skill for the pre-commit scan.

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain `--push` (push after committing), `--pr` (open a PR/MR after
pushing), and/or a free-text hint about what the change is.

## Steps

1. **Verify.** Run the verification gate first. Do not commit unverified code — if
   verification fails, fix it or stop; do not commit anyway.

2. **Read the diff.** `git status`, then `git diff` and `git diff --staged`. Read it; do not
   commit blind.

3. **Hygiene scan.** Scratch scripts, debug leftovers (`console.log`, `dd()`, `var_dump`,
   `debugger`), commented-out blocks, `.env` files, anything with a credential shape, editor
   artifacts. Raise what you find — do not silently include it and do not silently delete it.

4. **Stage deliberately.** Only the paths belonging to this commit. If unrelated changes are
   present, leave them and say what you left out. Never bundle unrelated work.

5. **Branch if needed.** If on the default branch and the change is non-trivial, create
   `<type>/<short-kebab-description>` — honoring any existing convention visible in
   `git branch -a`.

6. **Write the message.** Conventional Commits, imperative subject, ≤ 72 chars, specific
   enough that someone scanning `git log` can identify it. `fix: update` is never acceptable.
   Honor `commitlint.config.*` if present. Body only when the *why* is not obvious.

7. **Update `LOG.md`** if the work produced anything durable, and include it in the commit.

8. **Commit.** Never `--no-verify`. If a pre-commit hook fails, fix the cause.

9. **If `--push`:** check for divergence first, then push. Never force-push a shared branch.

10. **If `--pr`:** read the git remote to decide GitHub PR (`gh pr create`) or GitLab MR
    (`glab mr create`, or `git push -o merge_request.create`). Use the host's own vocabulary.
    Body: Summary, Changes, Verification, Notes — and link the ADR if the change implements one.
    If no CLI is available, push and hand back the compare URL.
